"""
Functions to make it easy to convert between the different frames-of-reference. In particular these
make it easy to navigate in terms of "metres from the current position" when using commands that take 
absolute positions in decimal degrees.

The methods are approximations only, and may be less accurate over longer distances, and when close 
to the Earth's poles.

Specifically, it provides:
* get_location_metres - Get LocationGlobal (decimal degrees) at distance (m) North & East of a given LocationGlobal.
* get_distance_metres - Get the distance between two LocationGlobal objects in metres
* get_bearing - Get the bearing in degrees to a LocationGlobal
"""


def get_location_metres(original_location, dNorth, dEast):
    """
    Returns a LocationGlobal object containing the latitude/longitude `dNorth` and `dEast` metres from the
    specified `original_location`. The returned LocationGlobal has the same `alt` value
    as `original_location`.

    The function is useful when you want to move the vehicle around specifying locations relative to
    the current vehicle position.

    The algorithm is relatively accurate over small distances (10m within 1km) except close to the poles.
